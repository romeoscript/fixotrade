				<p>Cryptocurrencies are sets of software protocols for generating digital tokens and for tracking transactions in a way
				that makes it hard to counterfeit or re-use tokens. Therefore, cryptocurrency trading involves trading on digital
				currencies/tokens. This form of trading has in fact only been around for a few years.

				One of the most common forms of digital currency is the Bitcoin which was released in 2009. It's initial price was set
				at less than 1 cent as at 2010.

				While it is still to experience its boom phase, it has quickly become a popular way of trading for many.

				One of the big benefits of this form of trading is the money that there is to be made. The bitcoin, for example, hit a
				market cap of $160 billion by November, 2017.

					There are considerably a few people trading cryptocurrencies which is an advantage because the market is yet to be
					saturated by others trying to get in on the game.

					Deutsche bank has shown an increasing appreciation for the transformative potential of both blockchain
					technology—becoming one of the first to spearhead the development of its own Ethereum-based blockchain—and the
					cryptocurrencies based on it.

					Just like Deutsche bank, Germany offers forex broker service, we also have cryptocurrency traders that specialize in the
					trading of this digital cash. Our job is to test them all out, put them through their paces and then present our
					information, for better result.
